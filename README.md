# vim_config

## Introduction
Repo of my vim confg, based on the example from the vim.wikia guides. After suffering a couple of computer failures, will ensure I can have a uniform config to download across platforms. 

## Installing a Vim Package manager
I've been using Vundle for the last few years and it's not too bad.

### To install Vundle
`git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim/`
